# 🎙️ Grit.AI Voice Transcription System

Welcome to the **Grit.AI Voice Transcription System** — a scalable, modular voice transcription application that captures audio inputs, processes them in real-time via API, and outputs structured, word-level transcripts.

This project is under active development, with plans for **biometric voice identification**, **multi-speaker handling**, **confidence calibration**, and much more.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Voice Capture**: Seamless recording of conversations.
- **Structured Transcripts**: Word-by-word breakdowns with timestamps and confidence scores.
- **API-Based Processing**: External API integration for fast and debounced data retrieval.
- **Speaker Identification** (Basic): Maps utterances to users (limited in environments with overlapping audio).
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed to support future expansion — voice biometrics, speaker diarization, UI dashboards, etc.
